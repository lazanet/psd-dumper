# PesStatsDatabase dumper
Tool which dumps latest snapshot of all stats from PesStatsDatabase (as well as latest updates).

## Requirements:
 - Python3
 - Beautiful Soup (from pip)
 - curl
 - lxml (`python3 -m pip install lxml`)
 
NEW! Now there is `index.php` which provides API that looks just like my [pesstatsdatabase-API](https://github.com/lazanet/pesstatsdatabase-API)! Note that you need to have latest dump in `data` folder.
